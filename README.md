I'm a Cloud Solutions Architect from 🇮🇹, living in 🇵🇱. I graduated as Industrial Designer at Polytechnic of Torino. After my studies I discovered my passion for web development, and started my adventure as web developer 🕷️. I studied JavaScript before Node.js was invented, HTML before HTML5, CSS before LESS and SASS. Many were still using IE6 back then, and nobody was making fun of jQuery!

I built my first web app using `PHP`, `MySQL`, `Apache` on `Windows` (WAMP). Since then, I built many web applications, using different tech stacks, both server and client side. I'm expert of Single Page Applications, I started with `Backbone`, `RequireJS`, and `Grunt`. 

I ❤️ many things in life. I maintain everything [in Neoteroi :octocat:](https://github.com/Neoteroi).
